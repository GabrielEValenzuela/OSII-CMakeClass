## Useful commands to explore this repository

To run `CMake` we need to execute

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The following is a resume of the branches of this repository:
- structure_and_executable : This is the point of start. Here we create a simple executable with CMake
- static_library : To our previous executable, we add a static library
- unit_tests : We integrate Unity as test framework. Modify our project structure.
